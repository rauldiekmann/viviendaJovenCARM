# üè° ViviendaJovenCarm üë´
ViviendaJovenCarm is a Real Estate portal tailored to young buyers eligible for government subsidies.
It provides listings specifically curated to meet the needs of this demographic, making the process of finding and purchasing a home more accessible and efficient.
It includes functionalities to calculate if an user is eligible for a subisidy to rent or buy a property

## Why ‚ùì
I wanted to combine in just one Real Estate portal both the process of finding a property and calculating if you are eligible for a government subsidy.
Usually, the government portals have a poor design and are flooded with irrelevant information. I wanted to condense everything in a minimalistic website
to find affordable properties, and know right away if you are eligible for a subsidy.

## Usage
To use ViviendaJovenCarm, simply browse the listings and search for properties based on your preferences. You can filter by location, price range, amenities, and more. Once you find a property you're interested in, you can view more details, or contact the seller directly through the platform.
